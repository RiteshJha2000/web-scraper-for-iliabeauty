Tracey L.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/25/2023,Best Lipstick EVER,I am a fanatic about trying to find lip color that doesn’t dry out your lips and stays on for long periods of time (I’m a busy nurse). Found it with Ilia…. And LOVE the color Memoir…. A little more pop than natural lip color. IN LOVE!
Michele D.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,08/23/2023,Fabu-lips!,Absolutely loved this tinted lip balm with spf for vacation! So smooth & buttery with the perfect tint. Did not get sticky at the beach! I will be buying other shades!!
Joy B.,Verified Buyer,Rated 4 out of 5,08/05/2023,Lovely feel and color,"I love the way this feels on my lips. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because it's not very long lasting. I have to reapply often throughout the day. I got 4 colors, they're all gorgeous.. this picture is lullaby, gone over 3 times on lips. I like how buildable it is. One swipe and it looks very healthy and natural. 3 swipes for a nice color to show. I have a neutral undertone and find the color flattering."
CINTHIA G.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,07/22/2023,Love love love,Beautiful color! It gives me the coverage and moisture I was looking for.
Jessica C.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,07/14/2023,Lovely,Great tinted lip balm. Not super moisturizing or oily. Easy to apply wash of color.
Kate D.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,06/28/2023,So hydrating!,I absolutely love this lip tint! I got the free sample pack of all the tint colors and and Wanderlust was definitely my favorite! My husband picked it out and he loved it as well. It's such a great way to add some color and feels so lightweight and moisturizing. I will definitely be purchasing a full size for every day wear!
Summer A.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,06/24/2023,"Moisturizing, Plumping, Deeply Saturated Lip Balm","At first, I was skeptical of the new formulation of the hydrating lip balms because I was such a fan of Ilia’s orignal product, Arabian Nights.
After using Wanderlust for quite sometime, I can vouch the new formulation is even better. What I love most about this product is how easy it is to layer to achieve increased moisture and more vivid color. With so many other lip products this results in a funky residue of excess product, but the hydrating products in this balm just absorb into your lips resulting in a healthy, moisturized, plump look which is particularly nice on dehydrated or aging lips. It also makes the colors very customizable. I think this product’s ingredients also help maintain lip health over time. Lastly, I would suggest that Wanderlust is a very versatile color for many skin tones that can be adjusted from a very sheer berry to a deep luscious look depending on your preference. And the product lasts a long time."
Tammy V.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,06/11/2023,Excellent,Beautiful and great match
Jennifer Z.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,06/07/2023,In love with this shade and this product,"Lullaby is my absolute go-to shade of this nourishing, luxurious, clean lip product. Dont go anywhere without it! I do find the color wears off quickly, but I don’t care because I really like whipping it out and reapplying. Such a mood booster!"
Danielle R.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,05/27/2023,Love,"I absolutely love this stuff. I have full lips and have never really been a makeup person but I always have some color on my lips. I have tried probably a hundred different lip products in my life and this is my number one favorite. Please don’t ever stop making it!! Feels like a balm; not dry like lipstick, not sticky like gloss and the color payoff is fantastic!!"
Janet N.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,04/25/2023,The most saturated colored lip balm I’ve found,"This stuff is amazing. I usually find that tinted lip balm fades after a short period of time, but not this stuff. It’s rich and hydrating and color stays for hours. I’m sold."
Carol G.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,04/22/2023,Comfortable to Wear!,"This lip balm is much more comfortable than traditional lipsticks. It almost has the feeling of a chapstick. Since my lips are dry all the time, I really love that! I plan to buy other colors!"
Donna S.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,01/27/2023,Super hydrating with great color,I use lip balm all day. I like a hydrating balm with color. This is the best product I have found after trying MANY brands I have tried. I wish it was cheaper since I want one in all of my pockets.
Laurie F.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,01/16/2023,Delightful,Moisturizing and a great neutral color for a minimal make-up look.

Diana S.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,12/13/2022,This is the BEST,"Recently for the holidays, I gifted myself several new ILIA products that I have not used before one of which was the Balmy Tint Lip Balm. This is a total keeper. I receive so many compliments since starting to use this product. The color is very rich, but in a surprising way also very natural. I used to put Chapstick on before I put on lipstick because it was very drying but this product serves both purposes, my lips feel hydrated, nourished, and plump! I would definitely recommend this product and will continue to use this as my go to lip accessory. I can’t wait to try new colors!"
ALLISON P.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,11/27/2022,The Perfect Tinted Lip Balm,I have searched for a long time for a tinted lip balm with wholesome ingredients that doesn't leave weird residue on my lips or make them dry and chalky after an hour. This is it! So glad I finally found it.
Hannah,Verified Buyer,Rated 4 out of 5,11/09/2022,Amazing colors but short lived,I really like this balm - the colors i’ve tried are gorgeous and I adore the ease of applying it. Just wish it was a little more moisturizing and longer lasting.
Debra M.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/20/2022,Loving all things Ilia !,"i recently received samples of the balmy lip tint and after trying, I immediately ordered two tubes (Wanderlust and Lady). The colors are perfect for me and I love the way it goes on , stays on , and nourishes my lips with moisture. At 63, I am only using Ilia products now! The face serum has changed my skin and I can’t imagine being a day without it !"
Marion C.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/29/2022,Love! My new fav!,Love the smooth yet light feel and perfect amount of natural looking color!
Amy P.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/10/2022,Moisture,Buildable color with moisture. My lips are chronically dry. I don’t use lipstick. This acts like a lipstick but with moisture.
maria s.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,08/24/2022,So Gooooood!,I have super dry lips and this balm feels so goooood! I bought Runaway first and loved the color but I wanted something a little more subtle for my morning walks on the beach. Hold me is a great peachy tone for me. I love the feel so much I’d actually spend this much $$& on clear!
Catherine S.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,07/22/2022,lips,wonderful lip balm/lipstick color is awesome will order another color soon
Kaitlyn C.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,07/14/2022,Love this lip tint!,This is the perfect shade for my complexion! It is not heavy or too bold and goes on like a chapstick. I highly recommend it!
Kelly C.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,07/10/2022,Beautiful neutral color,"Very nice every day color, my whole face is ilia products and my skin has never been happier! I'm wearing the skin tint in Diaz, before today on cheeks, glaze eye color, memoir on lips"
Sydney E.,Verified Buyer,Rated 4 out of 5,07/04/2022,Moisturizing and buildable color,"I love this product! It's not sticky at all and has buildable color. It makes my lips feel really soft and moisturized. The color memoir was just okay for me, it was a little too dark for my preference but it actually leaves a really pretty ""stain"" on your lips after it wears down which I really like. I will definitely be purchasing in other colors!"
Theresa B.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,07/03/2022,Lips so soft!,Love how soft and moisturized my lips feel with this balm! The lullaby shade is natural and brings back the shade my lips used to be! I had to buy another for my daughter since she wanted to steal mine!

Leslie S.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,07/01/2022,Love it!,"I am very pleased with the shade Ilia chose for me. Besides being a great color, the lip balm is soothing. You can also build on the color and use it as more of a lipstick."
Monica M.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,06/29/2022,Beautiful tint,I think this is the perfect amount of tint and beautiful color with a nice texture. Love it!

Lauren H.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,05/12/2022,Love this formula!,"Got this I. The color Heartbeats - love it! I wanted a sheer wash of color with a hydrating formula that would moisturize my lips. This is PERFECT, exactly what I’ve been searching for for the summer. It mostly feels like a lip balm with the perfect pop of color. I will definitely be getting more colors!"
Emily D.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,05/08/2022,Best!,This really is the best hydrating tinted lip balm out there. Love the creaminess and moisture. Can’t wait to get more shades!
Lisa G.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,04/27/2022,very smooth and moisturizing,"This is the perfect color - plus it feels so super nice to apply. Creamy, soft, moisturizing. I can't seem to wear anything that is too dry on my skin at this time in life. I highly recommend it. (I am wearing the tinted serum (in Paloma) in this photo... along with the Lullaby colored lip tint and Ilia mascara. Just love these products!!"
Sheryl J.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,04/20/2022,Runaway Perfect color!,"I loved the 1st lipstick I purchased (Wanderlust) a pretty berry color so I thought I’d try Runaway. Wow! It is a perfect pop of warm pink and nude color and actually makes my teeth look whiter. The moisture it provides is wonderful as I live in a very dry climate and just 1 swipe on my bottom lip and 1 swipe on my top lip lasts for hours without feeling heavy or goopy. I have white hair, light green eyes and fair to medium skin tone and live a very active lifestyle and I like a more natural look. All of the Ilia products just give me a fresh glow without looking too made up. The ingredients are good for your skin and the lipstick, multi sticks and the skin tint serum really last and you don’t need a lot to get that glowy fresh look. I get loads of compliments on my skin which is very nice at 59 years young! I feel that the ease of this makeup line helps my dry skin and makes me look and feel vibrant. I’d highly recommend it if you are into easy routines that make you look and feel good from the inside out!"
Anita T.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,04/05/2022,Amazing balm,I absolutely love the formula and there are so many great colors! I will definitely order more.

Ellen M.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,02/20/2022,Lovely lady shade!,"The Lady hydrating balm is a perfect shade for a mid-winter pick me up. My lips feel soft and smooth, not overly sticky! At 71 I am transitioning to a lighter coverage for a more natural look."
Ashley F.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,02/17/2022,Pretty!,Pretty color! I use chapstick underneath which really makes this look great!
ALICE J.,Verified Buyer,Rated 3 out of 5,02/12/2022,Feels nice,"Would like a sheer look , not a heavy finish"
Jessica L.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,01/24/2022,Long wear,"I love the color, and how this feels on my lips. It’s not sticky or dry and it seems to be a bit of a stain, it’s not an all day lip stair but I find even after eating it’s held up very well. It is currently winter where I am and it’s very dry, this has definitely helped keep my lips from drying out."
Jennifer G.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,12/09/2021,Pop of color,Perfect pop of color for my lips! Just enough red and pink for my fair skin tone!
Adriana D.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,11/04/2021,Amazing!,I absolutely love the color and how hydrated my lips feels all day. No weird white drink line with it either.
Brittney S.,Verified Buyer,Rated 4 out of 5,11/03/2021,Beautiful Color & Texture,"I really love the amount of pigment and the texture of this gloss. The color is far more visible than a standard chapstick (comparable to a lipstick) and the texture is smooth and not drying. My only complaint is that it doesn't stay very long. I would estimate that the color is visible for about 30 minutes, but less if you are eating or drinking. Otherwise, its lovely."
Dorothy,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/30/2021,Love it,"Weirdly, it took me a while to decide what I thought based on the sample. But I got this in Runaway and Wanderlust, and the more I wear it, the more I love it. Both colors are amazing, the feel and color is perfect. I also use both on cheeks, it’s soft and moisturizing and beautiful for cheeks as well. Photo has runaway on cheeks and bare lip/runaway on lip before and after."
Jenny G.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/26/2021,Awesome!,Love the color and the texture!
Laura L.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/20/2021,Order Every Color,"I love these. I have the older version of the tinted lip conditioner which is slightly thinner than this product but still gives the natural wash of color. Faded is the perfect cocoa brown for year round. I'll definitely order the comparable shade to Arabian Knights and the color Lady, too."
Jenny,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/06/2021,"Creamy, marshmellowy and buttery!","I don't Usually write reviews. but I love this product so much ! I've tried tons of lipsticks/balms, but this is the best. It glides on smoothly hydrates and it does not irritate your lips nor does it feel like anything is on it you just get the goodness of the soft pillowy feel."
Amy B.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/30/2021,I'd Buy Again,Its very moisturizing with just enough shine! I really like it and would get more colors!

Ctine,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,08/05/2021,Ilia wunderlust cool berry,I absolutely love this product. It’s such a smooth application and moisturizing on the lips. The shade that I received is so beautiful! It has a nice pop to my natural lip color! I want to purchase Every shade such a fun product.
Jen,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,07/13/2021,This Lip Balm Is My New Favorite!,"This is my new favorite lip balm! The color is beautiful and it keeps my lips feeling hydrated and looking glossy! When I first opened the tube of lip gloss, I noticed how rich the color is and expected it to be cakey-looking like lipstick but that isn’t the case at all! The lip balm glides over my lips easily and feels just like lip gloss, but with color. I love that I can make the color darker by swiping more onto my lips or just one application for a touch of color. The metal container it comes in is upscale and I love the light scent of vanilla."
Sophie S.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,07/03/2021,"Creamy, soft and beautiful shade!","When I first read about the Balmy Tint Lip Balm, I just couldn't resist! I bought three shades (Hold me, Lullaby and Lady) and I just love them. The lip balm feels like a second skin on my lips and feels very soft. I often have dry lips which are also sensitive, but since I use my lip balms, my lips are always hydrated and protected. In the future I really want to buy other shades (especially heartbeats). Thank you so much for this lip balm!"
COLLEEN C.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,06/20/2021,Loved it so much I ordered 3 more,Perfect for 40+ lips! Can’t wait to receive the other products I ordered based on this lippy. Also recommended to my mom!
Brenna E.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,06/14/2021,Absolutely Amazing,"This product is my new all time favorite lip. Firstly, the color is everything I've ever looked for. It's like my own lip color but more saturated and just works so perfectly with my light neutral skin tone, I'm completely obsessed. Secondly, the formula feels so light and nourishing on the lips. It lasts hours without drying up on my lips, and without making me lips peely with dry skin as some other lip products tend to do. It has a very subtle smell that I don't think is unnatural fragrance, I can't place it but it's yummy and light. I did not try the TLC before the balmy tint so I can't compare them, but this product is truly amazing and I am 100% going to try more colors."
Amanda T.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,06/14/2021,The perfect tinted lip,I love the feel and look of this lip color. It has a matte finish but is super soft and doesn’t have a bad taste.

Nicki F.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,06/08/2021,Finally Found the perfect tint,"Wow! This is exactly what I was looking for. The ILIA Balmy Tint Hydrating Lip Balm is super hydrating. I have very dry lips so I have trouble wearing lip stick so I was looking for something with a tint and hydrating. The minute I swiped it across my lips I was in love. Super smooth, goes on easy and just makes you feel beautiful. The color was perfect. I have used it almost every day and some days I’ll just do a quick swipe for a hint of color just to freshen up my look. Others days I go over it twice to get a richer color. My lips look so well hydrated and not cracking and dry anymore. Can’t wait to get another color. Perfect addition to your everyday and night out makeup routine."

It is very luxurious and has a nice weight to it. The all itself is moisturizing without being sticky or slick. I loved the wanderlust color applied normally then lightly blotted for a stain look. I do with the bullet was a bit thinner as it’s really easy to go outside the lines. With this color, it is a bit more noticeable. Overall, I really enjoy using this product and would love to get another color or two!"

Agnes,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,11/07/2023,Honestly my favourite makeup item in the world right now.,"I've been waiting a long time to find a lip product that actually works for me. I really struggle with lipstick as it just looks a mess in 5 minutes - rubs off, goes over my lip line, fades in the middle... I don't know how people actually wear it. So this little lip tint has been revolutionary as it's gentle, balmy, buildable and seems to look like the best version of my actual real lips. Even it if goes over the edges it sort of smushes in naturally and just looks soft and kissed. The colour (Heartbeats) I chose is the perfect warm soft red for my skin tone - it doen't seem to bring out all the other reds in my face like other tones do. And I now don't go anywhere without it. Thanks guys! You've made my tired wintery face a LOT happier."

Danielle D.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/29/2023,Beautiful color and feel,Most tinted lip balms soak into my lips and fade and travel into lip lines. Not this one. It’s thick and moisturizing and stays really well. The colors are beautiful. I’ll be buying in more colors for sure.
Adrianna D.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/26/2023,My color!,"Such a great color for me (a “winter.”) I usually fill in with lip pencil first, then apply the color. Like the effect, which is a bit sheer. Sweet!"

Chelsea M.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/14/2023,My Perfect Lip Product,"If I could only choose one lip product to use for the rest of my life, it would be these balmy tints. They're super moisturizing, they have buildable and even (not patchy at all) application of color, and they have a light vanilla scent. You also get a decent amount for the money. I have several colors of these, and I think they're absolutely perfect."

Ellen H.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/09/2023,"Beautiful, sheer color","Didn't know if this color (Memoir) would work for me. I have light olive skin and I have a hard time finding colors I think look good on me. But this one worked perfectly and its a genius multi-tasker as you can use it on the cheeks and lips. Have used it almost every day since I purchased it. Like that you can put more color on top of the first swipe to make it more intense. Love this product, will purchase more!"
Venitia R.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/09/2023,Best Lip Balm Ever,"I love the color and how it is buildable. I have tried every lip balm out there, and by far, this is the best. Thank you, Ilia!"
Laurie C.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/07/2023,Think popsicle,I love the look of this lipstick it's really buildable which means that if I want it to be more subtle I can. It kind of can resemble if you ate a cherry popsicle and it left your lips with a subtle tint which I absolutely love for summer and then for the holidays if I want it to be a rich red I'll just apply a couple coats.

Anne H.,Verified Buyer,Rated 4 out of 5,10/05/2023,Pretty Good,"LOVE the color and love the feel when it goes on, but it dries out and fades pretty quickly."
Nancy M.,Verified Buyer,Rated 2 out of 5,10/04/2023,Not as described,This shade has More brown tones. Not as described in the photo
Jessica H.,Verified Buyer,Rated 4 out of 5,10/02/2023,Everyday Balm,I don't like much color and I'm not a glossy girl. This balm is the perfect color and consistency for an everyday simple look! It goes on really smooth. I do have to reapply often but it is a balm and not a stain so I didn't expect it to be super long lasting. I'll definitely be buying again!
KTinsley L.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/02/2023,nice subtle color,subtle and moisturizing
Kathryn P.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,10/01/2023,perfect everyday balm,"I absolutely love this shade. It's a barely there pink, perfect for everyday wear. I love the formula, non sticky, hydrating. The only thing I would say is that after it has faded or after eating, no color is remaining so my lips look very pale. I would love a tad bit of stain. but for now, I just reapply."
Pamela D.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/27/2023,Lip balm,Love it. It’s not drying or sticky. Lasts quite a bit for a lip balm. Love the color. Goes with everything.

Roberta L.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/24/2023,Moist and Natural Color,Lullaby is a soft neutral shade with a touch of pink. This formula is very soothing and left my lips feeling moist with a bit of color. Just perfect! I have silver hair and light coloring and I can wear Lullaby everyday with any color clothes.
Tiffany P.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/22/2023,Love it!,"Beautiful complimentary colour that I think will suit a lot of people... it certainly worked for me! I often end up with products that are too orange when the colour goes on my skin, but that was not the case this time!"

Ann L.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/19/2023,Love the product,Color is great but a little too dark for me-I’ll keep but get lighter next time
Lisa B.,Verified Buyer,Rated 3 out of 5,09/17/2023,"Pretty color, but disappointed with shipping","Would have loved it, but by the time it arrived it was a melted mess that never recovered."
Samantha O.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/14/2023,Lady,"Beautiful neutral red that looks lovely against my fair skin. The perfect fall lip color. The balm has good pigmentation, and holds up well against everything but eating. However I find I don’t need to color touch up as often as other brands with things like drinking coffee. I’m very satisfied with this purchase."
Donna P.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/14/2023,Feels so good!,"Super smooth, feels great, long lasting, doesn’t dry my lips and doesn’t seem to transfer terribly! I’m going to get more colors! Excellent product for everyday use. It makes me feel pulled together when I’m having a no or low make up day"
Cindy S.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/14/2023,Perfection!,"I am so excited about these Balmy Tint Hydrating Lip Balms! I purchased two colors, Lady and Lullaby and both are absolutely beautiful. I am over 60 and have been unable to wear lipstick for several years as every one I tried chapped my lips terribly. I honestly did not have high hopes for the Ilia balms after so many disappointments elsewhere, but what a surprise! They are so luxurious and balmy, but not sticky, tacky, or glossy and they make my lips feel hydrated and protected. But the best, most amazing thing is the color - so saturated, buildable, and lovely. I couldn't be happier. So happy, in fact, that I purchased two more - one for my purse and another (Heartbeats) for my daughter. If you are hesitant due to the price, don't be - these are worth every penny. Also, no bad perfumey or chemically smell or taste."
Lisa R.,Verified Buyer,Rated 5 out of 5,09/14/2023,Perfect amount of color,Balmy tint is the perfect amount of color for every day wear and is super moisturizing.
